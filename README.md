## Steps

0) Make sure output directory has no files in it before
1) Run npm install
2) Run node index.js
3) Check output directory for PDF

### Important! output directory must be empty before running index.js

I'm not sure if there was a specific npm package we were supposed to use to make the pdf, because the directions did not list one. I tried several, before finding one that at least kind of worked(still very buggy). It does not seem to work perfectly, but that is ok for the purposes of this learning exercise. (let me know if there is something better please). You might have to run it twice... :(

Also, in the API call I was not able to locate a datapoint for github stars. If there is one, please let me know what the key is named.
