## Steps

1) Run npm install
2) Run node index.js
3) Check output directory for PDF

### Important! output directory must be empty before running index.js

I'm not sure if there was a specific npm package we were supposed to use to make the pdf, because the directions did not list one. I tried several, before finding one that at least kind of worked. It does not seem to work perfectly, but that is ok for the purposes of this learning exercise. (let me know if there is something better please)
